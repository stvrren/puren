        <h2>You are my saviour hun.<br> I am hoping these few words will make you smile :)</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>
            As I sit down to write about you, my love, I'm overwhelmed with nostalgia and gratitude.<br>
            It's hard to believe that we've come a long way since our 9th-grade days,<br>
            and now we're in 12th grade, with cherished memories and an unbreakable bond.<br>
            But what makes you truly special is the way you have been by my side, particularly since 11th grade,<br>
            when I was going through one of the most beautiful yet painful phases of my life.<br>
            You saw me fall head over heels in love and saw me<br>
            shatter into a million pieces when it didn't work out.<br>
            But what's truly remarkable is that you stood by me through it all,<br>
            offering a listening ear, a comforting presence,<br>
            and a reassuring voice that told me I was worth so much more.<br>
            And that, you are the loveliest part of our friendship. As I reflect on our journey together,<br>
            I'm filled with an immense sense of appreciation for the way you make me happy.<br>
            Your presence in my life is a constant source of joy, and I feel so lucky to have you by my side.<br>
            I want to tell you that I love you, not just as a friend, but as a sister, a confidante,<br>
            and a partner in every sense of the word.<br>
            And I'm not just talking about you; your family has also become like a second family to me,<br>
            making me feel loved and accepted in ways I never thought possible.<br>
            So, on your special day,<br>
            I want to say thank you, Puru, for being you, for being my rock,<br>
            and for being the sunshine that brightens up my day.<br>
            Here's to many more adventures, laughter, and memories together!
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h1 class="fancy-effect">I LOVE YOU</h1>
